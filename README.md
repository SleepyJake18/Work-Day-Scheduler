# Work-Day-Scheduler
A work day scheduler that uses the current time in your time zone. Dynamically adjusts styling to provide current date and time, as well as sets easy to interpret colors to let users know if a time has past or is in the future so they know whether or not they can still schedule activities for a certain time. Saves text input to local storage so even if app is closed, they can still re-open and view their daily work schedule.
